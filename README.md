**Game overview:**\
Mithraeum is a **pure on-chain** grand strategy game strongly focused on playersâ€™ social interactions. To be successful in the game, the players use their economic and military resources _(physical layer)_, alongside social and analytical skills converting them into political influence and thus spread their will upon others _(social layer)_. In other words, it is a strategy game that, thanks to the blockchain as a game theoretic playground, turns into a real time **political simulator**.
