# Gameplay

The gameplay of the Mithraeum is built on three main aspects:

Economy - The development of your settlement, production management, the choice of the optimal strategy for the distribution of resources and the necessary protection in case of aggressive actions of opponents

Military - Planning the composition of the army and its use: moving around the map, fighting with the forces of other players, as well as attacks on the economy and resources of your enemies

Diplomacy - The social component of the game. Interaction with other players, organize communities, create or join alliances and coalitions on the global map. Political participation in the life of the game.
